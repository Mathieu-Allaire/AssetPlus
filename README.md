# :hotel::heavy_plus_sign: ECSE223 AssetPlus Project: Team P1

This project was completed over the course of my 2023 Fall semester in a team of 6 people in the context of a course.

## Project Overview

We created the AssetPlus application for a hotel in the Montreal area. AssetPlus is intended to be
used by hotel staff to effectively manage hotel assets such as furniture and appliances in rooms and
hallways of a hotel as well as maintenance tasks.

For more information about the AssetPlus application, please consult the [wiki](../../wiki).
